# JavaScript Review 1 - Functions and Loops
This 5 challenge review covers core JavaScript concepts and is expected to take Students 1.5 hr or less

### Multiplications table on demand

Write a function that writes in the console or browser a multiplication table (in one column) of any number passed as parameter.

### Calculation

Write a program that writes in the console or browser all the multiples of 23 less than 500 and at the end writes the sum of all of them. *PRO TIP:* Google the % (modulus) operator on how you can use it to determine the numbers divisible by 23.

    Elements : 0 23 46 69 92 115 138 161 184 207 230 253 276 299 322 345 368
    391 414 437 460 483
    Sum : 5313

### Write Your Own `max()` function

Define a function max() that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Use the if-then-else construct available in Javascript. Provide appropriate User feedback.

### Write Your Own  `maxOfThree()` function

Define a function maxOfThree() that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Provide appropriate User feedback.

### Write Your Own  `isVowel()` function

Write a function that takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns true if it is a vowel, false otherwise. Provide appropriate User feedback.
